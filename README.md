# FMGTransformer
The code modification is based on our submitted paper (A Fusion-Guided FMGTransformer Network for Predicting
Methanol Yield in Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation), which aims to use deep learning algorithms to capture the nonlinear relationships between various reaction characteristics in order to predict methanol yield.

# Dependencies of the model
The code is written in python. The implementation of the model relies on the following libraries and tools:
python 3.9
pandas == 2.1.4
numpy == 1.26.3
pytorch == 2.1.4
scikit-learn == 1.3.2
keras == 2.7.0
matplotlib == 3.8.3
