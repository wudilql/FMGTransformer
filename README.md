# FMGTransformer
The code modification is based on our submitted paper (A Fusion-Guided FMGTransformer Network for Predicting
Methanol Yield in Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation), which aims to use deep learning algorithms to capture the nonlinear relationships between various reaction characteristics in order to predict methanol yield.

The data used in this project can be obtained from the paper by Manu Suvarna et al.(M. Suvarna, T. P. Araújo, J. Pérez-Ramírez, A generalized machine learning framework to predict the space-time yield of methanol from
thermocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation, Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 315 (2022) 121530. doi:10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121530.)
